6stee4 (Sixty Four) - Base64 EDPS - Encode, Decoder, Printer, Script - For Terminal (including CMD)

There was supposed to be a .exe application link. However I failed to make it work with PyInstaller.

The files keep looking for a specific directory instead of an Absolute Path.

The project is completely functional though, just make sure you execute the exec.py file.

There are absolutely no dependencies other than, as visible, Python.

To run:

python exec.py

This command applies to any operating system.
